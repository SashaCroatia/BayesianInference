\title{Prior-Recursive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Logistic Regression
Fits a binary logistic regression model using a prior-recursive approach with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). The dataset is partitioned into \code{k} groups and regression coefficients from each group are used to construct data-driven priors for the next group.}
\usage{
pr_hmc_norm(k, X, y, niter = 5000, nburnin = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{Integer, number of partitions to split the data into.}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix of predictors (n Ã— M), where \code{n} is the number of observations and \code{M} is the number of predictors.}

\item{y}{A numeric or integer vector of binary responses (0/1), length \code{n}.}

\item{niter}{Integer, total number of MCMC iterations to run for each partition. Default is 5000.}

\item{nburnin}{Integer, number of burn-in iterations to discard for each partition. Default is 1000.}
}
\value{
A matrix of posterior samples from the final partition, with columns corresponding to regression coefficients.
